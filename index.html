    <h1>
        MISSILE MAN OF INDIA
    </h1>
    <P>
        
        <b>Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</b>, born in Rameswaram, embarked on a remarkable journey from humble beginnings to the Rashtrapati Bhavan. His life was a symphony of science, resilience, and inspiration. As the “Missile Man,” he pioneered India’s nuclear prowess, leaving an indelible mark on history. But Kalam was more than a scientist; he was a teacher, a dreamer, and a beacon of hope. His words—“Dream, dream, dream”—echo through generations, urging us to reach for the stars. The classroom was his sanctuary, where equations danced, and curiosity thrived. His legacy lives on, igniting minds, lighting up the cosmos, and reminding us that dreams transform into destiny.
